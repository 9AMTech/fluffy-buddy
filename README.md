# Fluffy Buddy
This is a mock up project website based on a fake business. This project demonstrates the ability to find and implement APIs and JS Libraries.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

On the home screen, you'll see a Random Cat Fact that gets pulled from the Cat Facts API on refresh. When you click on in to see the "fluffies" you'll be greeted to a screen that contains a Javascript Carosel from the Bootstrap Carosel library. I was also able to code in a little easter egg on one of the fluffies pages!

## Optimizations

I would definitely go back and find a way to parse through potential API data. As it works currently the Cat Facts API works on a donation basis I guess you could call it. Anyone can input a "Cat Fact" into the API's database. This causes the API to sometimes pull nonsense as facts. No Cat Facts API, "oaqeiwuyrh903erp9q" is not a cat fact. 

## Lessons Learned:

- Making Javascript easter eggs are cool!
- Working with Javascript modules and then customizing them is a hard but rewarding task.
- APIs are pretty easy to work with.
